# Exocortex

Exocortex is a hypothetical artificial external information that works as augmentation to a person's brain.
It adds extra memory, processors and functionalities to a brain to make people smarter.

As this is all hypothetical, i'll use this repository as my own exocortex in the meantime. This will be my notebook and will keep it full of notes for reference and sharing. Mostly related to development but could be about anything.

So, welcome to my exocortex.
